## About

ICSharpCode.Decompiler is the decompiler engine used in [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/).

You can learn how to use it from the following samples/real-world applications:

* **decompiler-nuget-demos.ipynb** in the [ILSpy repository](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/). This shows the basics of using the NuGet.
* **ILSpyCmd** project in the [ILSpy repository](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/tree/master/ICSharpCode.ILSpyCmd). This dotnet tool shows automation of whole assembly decompilation.
* **ILSpy.Backend** in the [ILSpy Visual Studio Code Extension repository](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ilspy-vscode/tree/master/backend). This LSP shows listing / decompiling members.
* **ILSpy** itself. Complex, recommended only for advanced users and definitely **not** the place to get started.
